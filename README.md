## About Me

 - Name: Hayden Godwin
 - Email: godwin.20@wright.edu
 - Intended Major: Computer Science

## School Projects
 - Java Coding Projects: The Java projects I am going to be completing are not yet determined because I am completing them for my Computer Science classes. Some Java project I have completed are: replica New York Times spelling bee game, Catacomb game, Simon Says game with colors, and a simple trivia answer game
 
 - System Administrator Projects: I am going to be learning how to use GitHub, work in a computer terminal, how to use a AWS virtual server, and learn about Linux and Windows system administration

## Personal Projects
 - Upgrading computers at my job: Over the next couple of months I am upgrading the point of sales computers at my job. This project involves building new computers, upgrading software to Windows 11, and installing the computers in the store locations.
 
 - Building my hobby business: Within the last 2 months, I have started to sell 3d printed products on an online platform called Etsy. I really enjoy doing this business on the side because it has taught me a lot about business and has generated some income. I plan on continuing to build this business to the point where I am making a sale a day. Link to my Etsy page: https://3dprintedbyhaydeng.etsy.com 
 
 - Building a FPV drone: During the Summer of 2024, I discovered FPV drones and I decided to research and purchase the parts needed to build one. I have built it to the point to where it can fly, but I still need to add a video transmitter so I am able to fly from the drones perspective. I have been very busy with school and work lately, but I have full intentions for finishing the build and flying it this Summer.

 ## Internships for the Summer of 2025

 This Summer, I am going to try my best to land a internship for a I.T. position. I have worked as a I.T. intern at a school during the Summer of 2024, but I am going to try and get a I.T. internship in a different environment. The environments I am interested in is: offices, small business, or industrial.
